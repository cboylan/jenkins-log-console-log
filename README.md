# Console Log to Workspace

This is a Jenkins plug-in that allows you to save the console log to a file in the
build's workspace for further processing.

One of its uses is to allow post-processing tools such as log analyzers that
only reads files to do its work.

It is available as a build-step and as a post-build action.
